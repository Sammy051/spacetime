spacetime
=========

Java version of Edwin F. Taylor's famous SPACETIME program.
Original Java version (2007) by Slavom√≠r Tuleja.

Program description
-------------------

Need a ride? Hop in. We're going to take a drive on the Spacetime
superhighway. You'll see things you've never seen before: time dilation,
Lorentz contraction, the twin paradox, and the Doppler shift. You'll learn
about the relative synchronization of clocks, the invariance of the speed of
light, and the law of addition of velocities.

Spacetime depicts relativistic motion in one space dimension using two separate
but related displays: the Spacetime Highway and the more traditional Spacetime
Diagram. On the highway, objects in different lanes move at different
speeds. The diagram shows a corresponding plot of position versus time that
displays the locations of events and the trajectories of objects in
spacetime. The two windows share data, so you can view them independently or
see both at once using a split screen.

Spacetime provides an excellent introduction to the study of special
relativity. It accurately displays all the clocks for a given scenario, and it
performs the mathematical calculations so vital to understanding an otherwise
difficult subject. This frees students from the entanglements of algebra and
square roots and enables them to concentrate on the topic at hand.
